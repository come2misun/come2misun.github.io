* Computing means, variances and other summary statistics for a list of numbers
* Fitting a line to a set of data points using linear regression
* Fitting a curve to a set of data points
* Finding a smooth curve that passes through a collection of points (interpolation)
* Fitting a parametric model to a set of measurements using least-squares methods
* Solving equations involving real-valued functions (i.e. root-finding)
* Solving systems of linear equations
* Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
* Minimizing multi-dimensional functions
* Generating random numbers with more restrictions (e.g distribution, range) than what is possible using the JDK
* Generating random samples and/or datasets that are "like" the data in an input file
* Performing statistical significance tests
* Miscellaneous mathematical functions such as factorials, binomial coefficients and "special functions" (e.g. gamma, beta functions)
